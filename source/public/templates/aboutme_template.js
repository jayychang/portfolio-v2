      'But who am I really? It\'s simple: I am someone who loves coding, eating and being outside. Coding to me is more than just knowing algorithms and creating apps. Don\'t get me wrong, having those skills are important. However for me, to be able to express myself and have fun while coding and seeing people enjoy using the products I create is what really puts a smile on face (a nice bowl of ramen in front me of me does that too).',
